physician by which a triumphant communist movement introduced its
rule

but there are more instructive stories about nicholas including his
reaction to learning in november eighteen ninety four that his father
alexander had died and that he nicholas was now
emperor of all russia

as told by simon sebag montenori in his book twenty
six year old nicholai aleksandrovich romanov broke down in tears and
ran to his sister
